<h2 id="the-us-medical-device-industry">The U.S. Medical Device Industry</h2>

<p><span class="imgright"><img src="/images/medicaltech_0-346x356.jpg" alt="mri image" /></span></p>

<p>The United States remains the largest medical
device market in the world with a market size of around $110 billion, and it is
expected to reach $133 billion by 2016.  The U.S. market value represented about 38 percent of the
global medical device market in 2012.  U.S.
exports of medical devices in key product categories identified by the
Department of Commerce (DOC) exceeded $44 billion in 2012, a more than 7
percent increase from the previous year.</p>

<p>There are more than 6,500 medical device
companies in the U.S., mostly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  More than 80 percent of medical device
companies have fewer than 50 employees, and many (notably innovative start-up
companies) have little or no sales revenue. 
Medical device companies are located throughout the country, but are
mainly concentrated in regions known for other high-technology industries, such
as microelectronics and biotechnology. 
The states with the highest number of medical device companies include
California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois,
Minnesota and Georgia.  Other states with
significant sector employment include Washington, Wisconsin, and Texas.</p>

<p>U.S. medical device
companies are highly regarded globally for their innovations and high
technology products. Investment in
medical device research and development more than doubled during the 1990s, and
research and development investment in the domestic sector remains more than
twice the average for all U.S. manufacturers.  </p>

<p>The United States also holds a competitive
advantage in several industries that the medical device industry relies upon,
including microelectronics, telecommunications, instrumentation, biotechnology,
and software development.  Collaborations
have led to recent advances including neuro-stimulators, stent technologies,
biomarkers, robotic assistance and implantable electronic devices.  Since the industry is fueled by innovation
and the ongoing quest for better ways of treating or diagnosing medical problems,
the future growth of this sector remains positive.</p>
