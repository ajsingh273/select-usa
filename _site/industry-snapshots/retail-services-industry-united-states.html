<p><strong>Retailers</strong>: This subsector employs approximately one out of five Americans. According to the National Retail Federation, independent and privately held retail businesses account for about 95 percent of the retail industry. </p>

<p><strong>Franchisers</strong>: Franchising has provided business opportunities in the United States for more than 150 years. The model is widely embraced because it provides an established plan for business expansion and a means of spreading risk. Franchising also offers assistance and support for new business owners by passing on a proven business model, along with training and support, advertising programs, accounting and payroll management, and discounted group rates for employee health insurance.  </p>
