<h2 id="the-us-pharmaceutical-industry">The U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry</h2>

<p><span class="imgright"><img src="/images/pharm1.jpg" alt="pharmaceuticals - pills on scoop" /></span></p>

<p>The
United States is the world’s largest market for pharmaceuticals and the world
leader in biopharmaceutical research.  According
to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA), U.S.
firms conduct the majority of the world’s research and development in pharmaceuticals
and hold the intellectual property rights on most new medicines.  The
biopharmaceutical pipeline also has over 5,000 new medicines currently in
development around the world with approximately 3,400 compounds currently being
studied in the United States - more than in any other region around the world.  </p>

<p>More
than 810,000 people work in the biopharmaceutical industry in the United States
as of 2012, and the industry supports a total of nearly 3.4 million jobs across
the U.S. economy, including jobs directly in biopharmaceutical companies, jobs
with vendor companies in the broad biopharmaceutical supply chain, and jobs
created by the economic activity of the biopharmaceutical industry workforce.  The biopharmaceutical sector is one of the
most research and development (R&amp;D)-intensive in the United States, with companies
investing more than 10 times the amount of R&amp;D per employee than all
manufacturing industries overall.  </p>

<p>The markets for
biologics, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and generics show the most
potential for growth and have become increasingly competitive.  Biologics account for a quarter of all new
drugs in clinical trials or awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval.  OTC market growth will be
driven by a growing aging population and consumer trend to self-medication, and
the conversion of drugs from prescription to non-prescription or OTC status.  </p>

<p>The U.S. market
is the world’s largest free-pricing market for pharmaceuticals and has a
favorable patent and regulatory environment.  Product success is largely
based on competition in product quality, safety and efficacy and price.  U.S. government support of biomedical
research, along with its unparalleled scientific and research base and
innovative biotechnology sector, make the U.S. market the preferred home for
growth in the pharmaceutical industry.   </p>

<h2 id="industry-subsectors">Industry Subsectors</h2>

<p>The
<strong>innovative pharmaceutical industry</strong> in the United States produces
chemically-derived drugs developed as a result of extensive R&amp;D and
clinical trials in both humans and animals. 
The innovator relies on patents and other forms of intellectual property
rights to justify the investment required to bring a product to market (the
U.S. patent term is 20 years).  The
pharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on the development of new
molecules to replace the revenue stream of older drugs that have come to the
expiration of their patent terms. 
Several large multinationals produce the majority of innovative
pharmaceuticals globally, but they have come to rely more heavily on research
performed by industry partners, including smaller, innovative manufacturers.  Pricing of innovative pharmaceuticals is
designed to recapture R&amp;D expenditures.</p>

<p>The**
biopharmaceutical industry** produces medical drugs derived from life forms
(biologics). These include proteins (including antibodies), and nucleic acids
(DNA, RNA or antisense oligonucleotides) used for therapeutic or in vivo
diagnostic purposes, and are produced by means other than direct extraction
from a native (non-engineered) biological source.  A potentially controversial method of
producing biopharmaceuticals involves transgenic organisms, particularly plants
and animals that have been genetically modified to produce drugs.  The biopharmaceutical industry relies heavily
on research performed by small companies and academic institutions that is
either acquired by large companies that can bring the products to
commercialization, or independently financed.</p>

<p><span class="imgright"><img src="/images/pharm2.jpg" alt="pharmaceutical research workers" title="pharmaceutical research workers" /></span></p>

<p>**Biologics
**(both biologics and biosimilars) include a wide range of products such as
vaccines, therapeutic proteins, blood and blood components, tissues, etc.  Major pharmaceutical companies continue to
diversify into biologics through acquisitions of biotechnology companies,
in-licensing of products, and R&amp;D alliances.  Some biotech firms have chosen to license
their products through joint ventures with multinational pharmaceutical
partners, while reserving rights to the domestic market.  The term biosimilar refers to products that have similar properties to
existing biologic products. </p>

<p>The
<strong>generic pharmaceutical industry</strong> produces copies of innovative pharmaceuticals
that contain the same active ingredient, are identical in strength, dosage
form, and route of administration.  In
the United States, upon patent expiration or a successful challenge of relevant
patents, a manufacturer can produce a generic drug as long as the drug meets
USFDA regulatory requirements and USFDA provides clearance to the
applicant.  The prices of generic drugs
are typically lower than the prices of innovative drugs.  Many generic drug manufacturers are also
producers of biosimilars.  Generic drug
manufacturing is heavily reliant on efficient production methods and
distribution chains, and based on volume rather than price to make
profits.  Regulatory systems governing
patent expiration are important to generic producers, as are approval systems
for biologics and biosimilars.</p>
