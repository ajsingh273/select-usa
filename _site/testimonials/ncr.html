<p><span class="imgright"><img src="/images/ncr-logo_pantone.jpg" alt="NCR Logo" /></span>In June 2009, American technology company NCR Corp. selected two locations in Georgia as sites for its worldwide headquarters and a new North American manufacturing plant. The moves were expected to create an estimated 1,250 jobs in Duluth, Georgia, and 870 jobs in Columbus, Georgia.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Our decision to bring our North American ATM manufacturing in-house was driven by our belief that as self-service ATM technology becomes more innovative and strategic to financial institutions, the ability to control manufacturing in key markets becomes a core and competitive advantage to our growth strategy… “  </strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>“NCR recognized that by in-sourcing their production, they would be able to decrease time-to-market, improve their internal collaboration, and lower their operating costs.”</strong></em> </p>

<p><em>-Peter Dorsman, NCR Senior Vice President of Global Operations</em></p>

<p>NCR chose to invest in the United States and Georgia because of its pro-business environment and outstanding education and workforce development initiatives. </p>
