<p>Farouk Systems, a $1 billion manufacturer of professional hair care and spa products, moved all of its production<span class="imgright"><img src="/images/farouk_group_logo-200x201.jpg" alt="Farouk Systems Logo" /></span> from South Korea and China to the United States and Houston, Texas, in July 2009. </p>

<p>Owner Farouk Shami said the decision was clear.  Outsourcing led to a loss of control over manufacturing and distribution, and although raw materials and labor costs in the U.S. are higher than in Asia, there he was forced to spend about $500,000 a month to fight counterfeiting. </p>

<p>Farouk Systems, a $1 billion manufacturer of professional hair care and spa products, is continuing to expand its Houston, TX facilities.
