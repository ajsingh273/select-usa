<p>The new Canon USA, Inc. headquarters followed close on the heels of <a href="http://www.cvi.canon.com/About_Us/aboutUsLandingPage.shtml">a new production facility constructed in Newport News, Virginia</a> in May 2009. The facility manufactures cartridges for laser printers that incorporate Canon’s proprietary high-speed, automated technology for cartridge production and supplies the North American market. Canon expected close to 1,000 new jobs to be created as production expands at the new 700,000-square-foot facility.</p>

<p>Canon has also developed a Technical Training Academy on the Newport News campus, which will equip workers with skills in advanced manufacturing support and product repair operations. The company chose to expand in Virginia and the United States because of its support as Canon hires quickly and develops a highly skilled and technical workforce. </p>
